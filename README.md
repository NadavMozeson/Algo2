# Algorithms 2

A simple and visualized method to track and understand the following algorithms.
- BFS
- DFS
- Topologic Sort
- Kosaraju-Sharir
- Kruskal
- Prim
- Dijkstra
- Bellman-Ford
- Floyd-Warshall
- DAG Shortest Path

## Installation

Use pip to install the required libraries used to run the code.
### Install commands for libraries:

```bash
pip install networkx
```
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
```bash
pip install tabulate
```

## Usage
### Running an Algorithm
#### Run the script and a GUI window will open on what algorithm you wish to run, select one from the list and press 'Next':

- **Load Graph:** Load a graph from a file.
- **Random/Draw:** Choose if to get a random graph or if you wish to draw one.
- **Save Graph:** Choose if you wish to save the graph for the next run/s.
- More fields will show depending on other choices made.
#### When selecting 'Draw' a drawing page will open when selecting 'Submit'
- **Left-Click:** Create a new Node
- **Right-Click:** Right-click on a node and then on another node to make an edge between the nodes.
- **Save Graph:** Close the draw GUI to save the graph and continue the run.

### Using Debugger
Run the code using a debugger if you wish to track the algorithms.
